# Project Context and Reminders

## Docker Environment
**IMPORTANT: This project runs using Docker Compose.**
- All commands should be run inside Docker containers using `docker compose exec <service> <command>`
- Backend commands: Use `docker compose exec backend python manage.py <command>`
- Frontend commands: Use `docker compose exec frontend npm <command>`
- Never assume commands run directly on the host - always use Docker
- Services are defined in `docker-compose.yml` at the project root

## Project Structure
- Backend: Django REST Framework in `/backend` directory
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript in `/frontend` directory
- Both services are containerized and run via Docker Compose

## Common Docker Commands
- Start services: `docker compose up` or `docker compose up -d`
- Stop services: `docker compose down`
- View logs: `docker compose logs -f <service>`
- Rebuild: `docker compose build` or `docker compose up --build`
- Execute commands: `docker compose exec <service> <command>`

## Django Migrations
**IMPORTANT: When model changes are made, migrations may need to be created.**
- After modifying Django models, run: `docker compose exec backend python manage.py makemigrations`
- Then apply migrations: `docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate`
- Always check if migrations are needed after model changes (adding/removing fields, changing field types, etc.)
